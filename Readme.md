Using C++ to implement TS


Type the following command to compile the program:
```cpp
make
```
Type the following command to run the program:
```cpp
./TS [Run] [Iteration] [T_size] [Capacity_file] [Weight_file] [Profit_file]
```

For example
```cpp
./TS 51 5000 50 ./01knapsack/p08_c.txt ./01knapsack/p08_w.txt  ./01knapsack/p08_p.txt 

```
